### Problem Statement?
How do you measure justice? And how do you solve the problem of racism in policing? We look for factors that drive racial disparities in policing by analyzing census and police department deployment data. The ultimate goal is to inform police agencies where they can make improvements by identifying deployment areas where racial disparities exist and are not explainable by crime rates and poverty levels.

### Summary about the analyses and visualizations
This project shows different visualizations and analysis of the
dataset about policing equity in 2016 through different factors. This
dataset has 2383 rows and 47 columns where different results have been
concluded racially and it has been checked that how different crimes
have happened throughout the year through which police department can
learn and grow accordingly. All of the key findings from the project are
defined below: <br>
